# display-event-object

This program assists the user in learning about a specific set of DOM events
by displaying their Event Objects in the JavaScript console, as well as
links to their MDN documentation.

It was created in response to suggestions by Zac Gordon in his course
JavaScript for WordPress, in Lesson 1.4.8 - A Look at More Events.

The code borrows heavily from the sample code for
Lesson 1.4.1 - Introduction to DOM Events.
