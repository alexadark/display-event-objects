# display-event-object

This program assists the user in learning about a specific set of events
by examining their Event Objects in the JavaScript console.

It was created in response to a suggestion by Zac Gordon in his course
JavaScript for WordPress, in Lesson 1.4.8 - A Look at More Events.

The code borrows heavily from the sample code for
Lesson 1.4.1 - Introduction to DOM Events.
